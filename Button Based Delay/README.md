### Extra Work
## Reset Button
(Works)
Reset Button sets the blink back to 10Hz for all processors

## Button Based Hertz
Most likely using two buttons, what if instead of making a delay loop based on the time, the user could instead enter a mode where the number of times they pressed the button would become the number in Hz of the blinking rate? How do you think you would implement that with just one button?
